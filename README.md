# Number-Game-Task-1-Codsoft
A simple console-based Number Guessing Game built using Java. This project was developed as part of the CodSoft Internship Program, and it demonstrates the use of core Java concepts such as loops, conditionals, random number generation, input handling, and basic game logic.

📌 Features
✅ Random number generation between 1 and 100

🔢 User inputs guesses with real-time feedback: "Too high", "Too low", or "Correct"

🎯 Limited number of attempts per round

🔁 Multiple rounds support

🏆 Scoring system based on correct guesses

🧠 Input validation to avoid crashes
